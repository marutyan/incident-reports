The Terp Network testnet halted at block `694200`, for the network upgrade proposed. Ideally, the upgrade should halt the production of new blocks momentarily, while independent nodes upgrade their terp-core daemon to the latest version

# Halt

This is suspected to have occured due to implementations with the dragonberry patch.
